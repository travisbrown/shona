# Shona

This branch of the Shona project is a demonstration by [Travis Brown](https://twitter.com/travisbrown)
of how Scala 2.10's `def` macros can be used to create references to
singleton types. It's a little more verbose without type macros, since we need a stable identifier
in order to be able to refer to the type member:

``` scala
val id = Sing("id")
val name = Sing("name")
val venue = Sing("venue")

val venueV = Vertex[venue.T] ~ (
  int   [id.T],
  string[name.T]
)
```

Instead of the much more concise version in `master`:

``` scala
val venue = Vertex[label("venue")] ~ (
  int   [label("id")], 
  string[label("name")]
)
```

But it works more or less the sameâ€”e.g., `id.T` is exactly the same type as `label("id")`.
